    Dear nephew,

    You should read this when you arrive to the island 
    beach. It must have been a long journey, so first
    let me congratulate you !

    Your path should be marked with cairns, so just
    make sure you follow them (press up).

                            On this island, the gem I gave
                            you has a unique effect. When 
                            enabled (press e), it will cancel 
                            gravity for objects near you,
                            allowing to move them around.

    I hope you can succeed in finding the source of
    these incredible physical properties.
                                          (press space to close)
